# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

**Future Interns - Machine Learning Internship (Task 3)**

This project aims to segment customers into meaningful groups based on demographic and behavioral data using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Group similar customers based on behavior & demographics
- Use clustering (K-Means) to find natural groupings
- Visualize and interpret customer segments

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Simulated customer support dataset  
- Includes: Age, Gender, Product Purchased, Priority, Channel, Satisfaction Rating

---

## 📊 Outputs

- Elbow Method to select optimal number of clusters  
- KMeans clustering applied  
- Pairplot visualization for clusters  
- Insights on different customer segments
